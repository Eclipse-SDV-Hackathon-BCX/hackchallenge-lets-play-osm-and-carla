# Hack Challenge "Letâ€™s Play OpenStreepMap and CARLA"

## What is CARLA?

[CARLA](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla) is an open-source simulator for autonomous driving research. CARLA has been developed from the ground up to support development, training, and validation of autonomous driving systems. In addition to open-source code and protocols, CARLA provides open digital assets (urban layouts, buildings, vehicles) that were created for this purpose and can be used freely. The simulation platform supports flexible specification of sensor suites and environmental conditions.
