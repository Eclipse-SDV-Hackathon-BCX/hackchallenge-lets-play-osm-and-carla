# Hack Challenge "Let’s Play OpenStreepMap and CARLA"

## What is CARLA?

[CARLA](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla) is an open-source simulator for autonomous driving research. CARLA has been developed from the ground up to support development, training, and validation of autonomous driving systems. In addition to open-source code and protocols, CARLA provides open digital assets (urban layouts, buildings, vehicles) that were created for this purpose and can be used freely. The simulation platform supports flexible specification of sensor suites and environmental conditions.

## How to get it ?
Possible options:
 - Got to release page of [CARLA-Releases](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/releases) and download it for your operating system.
   Native packages are available for
    - Windows
    - Ubuntu
 - Also Docker-Images are available. Follow the [instructions](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build_docker/).
 - **Best option**: In addition for the hackathon a compressed package with two simulators has been created (Windows only).

### Content of the simulator package (provided)

| Simulator                                                                                               | Example Projects |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| [AirSim with CityEnvironment (v1.8.1)](https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim/releases/tag/v1.8.1-windows) | Hello, Driving   |
| [CARLA (v0.9.13)](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/releases/tag/0.9.13)                         | Hello, Driving   |

* Portable Python 3.7
* Portable Visual Studio Code
* Scripts and helper tooling with task application

### Unpack the package

Get it from [here](https://github.com/Eclipse-SDV-Hackathon-BCX/hackchallenge-lets-play-osm-and-carla/releases/tag/v1.0.0-pre). 
The package is quite huge. All compressed parts together 6.3 GB and uncompressed **19.5GB**. Make sure that you have enough free diskspace for downloading an uncompressing the archive. The archive format is 7z. A installer is provided on the release page or can be downloaded and installed from [official website](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html).

* right-click on ```*.7z.001``` file and choose ```7-Zip --> Extract files...```
